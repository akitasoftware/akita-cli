# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Drop in Akita for instant API observability.

Powered by eBPF and state-of-the-art API traffic modeling algorithms, Akita
enables any developer to understand and track API endpoints and their usage in
real time:

  * **Understand what API endpoints you have.** Get a continuously up-to-date,
    searchable map of your API endpoints, fields, data types, and more. Export
    as OpenAPI specs.

  * **Understand API usage.** Get an automatically updated, per-endpoint view
    of volume, latency, and errorsâ€”without having to make code changes or build
    your own dashboards.

  * **Automatically understand API behavior changes.** Quickly get a summary of
    changes to performance and errors, added and removed endpoints, and more.

Simply drop Akita into your system to understand your system behavior, without
having to use a proxy or instrument code service by service.

We're in beta and would love to have you try us out!
