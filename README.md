# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Drop-in API monitoring, no code changes necessary.

Built for busy developer teams who don't have time to become experts in monitoring and observability, Akita makes it possible to quickly track API endpoints and their usage in real time.

  * **See API endpoints.** Automatically get a searchable map of your API endpoints in use. Explore by latency, errors, and usage. Export as OpenAPI specs.
  * **Get drop-in API monitoring.** Get a drop-in view of volume, latency, and errors, updated in near real-time. Set per-endpoint alerts.
  * **Quickly understand the impact of changes.** Keep track of the endpoints you care about and identify how new deployments impact your endpoints.

Simply drop Akita into your system to understand your system behavior, without having to instrument code or build your own dashboards.

We're in beta and would love to have you try us out! [Create an account in the Akita App](https://app.akita.software/login?sign_up) to get started.

## About this repo
This is the open-source repository for the community version of our CLI, and is
intended for use with the Akita console. This community version of the CLI does
not include functionality for inferring types and data formats. This
functionality is available only in the `akita` binary that we distribute.

## Running this repo

### How to build
Running the following commands will generate the `akita-cli` binary:
1. Install [Go 1.18 or above](https://golang.org/doc/install). 
2. Install `libpcap`
    - For Homebrew on mac: `brew install libpcap`
    - For Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install libpcap-dev`
3. `make`


### How to test

1. Install [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock): `go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen`
2. `make test`

### How to use

See our docs: [Single Host/VM](https://docs.akita.software/docs/run-locally).
